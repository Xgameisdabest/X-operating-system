# X operating system (in beta)
 
 This project is now *may be* compatible with all os now.
 
 About: A small project fully coded in Python made by me. Not an actual operating system, but it just sounds cool so I just call it like that :3.

History: The first version of this is actually not named "X operating system" like what you see now. It was named "notepad but crappy ecks dee". After 4 months of no update, I decided to get back to the project and changed the name to "X operating system".

- This project is INCOMPLETE, but it will be completed in the full version so I hope you enjoy playing around with the beta version :3

HOW TO DOWNLOAD (on Windows): 
- Firstly, click on the releases section on the page, you should see it on the right
- Secondly, download the latest version which has the "latest" tag on the right of the name
- Thirdly, open the .zip file that you have just downloaded then click on the "X operating system" file in the zip file that you just opened
(NOTE: WINDOWS SECURITY SYSTEM WILL SCAN THE .zip FILE AFTER YOU DOWNLOADED, SO YOU WILL HAVE TO WAIT AROUND 10 SECONDS FOR IT TO OPEN!)
- Finally, scroll down to the bottom of the file then click on the .exe file then use X Operating System freely!

HOW TO DOWNLOAD (on Linux):
- git clone https://github.com/Xgameisdabest/X-operating-system--in-beta-.git
- run the xos-init.sh file (oh, also right click it and choose properties and give it a permission to run as a program)
- then ./xos-init.sh
- thats all
