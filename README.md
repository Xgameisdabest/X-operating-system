# X operating system (in beta)
 
- A small project fully coded in python made by me. NOT AN ACTUAL OPERATING SYSTEM
 
About: This project is a small project of me playing around with codes.

History: The first version of this is actually not named "X operating system" like what you see now. It was named "notepad but crappy ecks dee". After 4 months of no update, I decided to get back to the project and changed the name to "X operating system".

- This project is INCOMPLETE, but it will be completed in the full version so I hope you enjoy playing around with the beta version :3

HOW TO DOWNLOAD: 
- Firstly, click on the releases section on the page, you should see it on the right
- Secondly, download the latest version which has the "latest" tag on the right of the name
- Thirdly, open the .zip file that you have just downloaded then click on the "X operating system" file in the zip file that you just opened
(NOTE: WINDOWS SECURITY SYSTEM WILL SCAN THE .zip FILE AFTER YOU DOWNLOADED, SO YOU WILL HAVE TO WAIT AROUND 10 SECONDS FOR IT TO OPEN!)
- Finally, scroll down to the bottom of the file then click on the .exe file then use X Operating System freely!


Thank you,
 Xgame
